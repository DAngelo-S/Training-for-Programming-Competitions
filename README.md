# Training for Programming Competitions

The purpouse of this repository is to acumulate sources, my codes, my studies of data structures and algorithms and my goals and to-do lists.

In this repository, I'll organize myself focusing in doing well in the next programming competitions.

If you want to use my organization too, I recommend you to check out the folder 'Scripts" first. There are some scripts that are really useful to me to follow my progress and to automizate some repetitive tasks.

Next, my to-do lists.
